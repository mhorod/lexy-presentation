This is a brief overview of [foonathan/lexy](https://github.com/foonathan/lexy) parser library for my C++ course project.

Examples include:
- basic structure of the library
- using those basics to parse ipv4 address
- simple operations on bytes
- some advanced combinators
- simplified calculator to illustrate expression parsing
- parsing very simple functional syntax
